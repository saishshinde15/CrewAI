AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several \\nbenchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails \\nbehind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.\\n2. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research.  In 2023, industry produced 51 notable \\nmachine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from \\nindustry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.\\n3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs \\nof state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an \\nestimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.\\n4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI \\nmodels. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European \\nUnion’s 21 and China’s 15. \\n5. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.  \\nNew research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting.  \\nLeading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different \\nresponsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and  \\nlimitations of top AI models.\\n6. Generative AI investment skyrockets.  Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last \\nyear, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in \\nthe generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial \\nfundraising rounds.\\n7 . The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In \\n2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more \\nquickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge \\nthe skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper \\noversight can lead to diminished performance. \\n5')"
