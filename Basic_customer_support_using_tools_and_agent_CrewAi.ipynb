            "The recent release of Llama 3.1 offers models with an incredible level of performance, closing the gap between closed-source and open-weight models. Instead of using frozen, general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, you can fine-tune Llama 3.1 for your specific use cases to achieve better performance and customizability at a lower cost.\n",
            "In this article, we will provide a comprehensive overview of supervised fine-tuning. We will compare it to prompt engineering to understand when it makes sense to use it, detail the main techniques with their pros and cons, and introduce major concepts, such as LoRA hyperparameters, storage formats, and chat templates. Finally, we will implement it in practice by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B in Google Colab with state-of-the-art optimization using Unsloth.\n",
            "All the code used in this article is available on Google Colab and in the LLM Course. Special thanks to Daniel Han for answering my questions.\n",
            "\t\tüîß Supervised Fine-Tuning\n",
            "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a method to improve and customize pre-trained LLMs. It involves retraining base models on a smaller dataset of instructions and answers. The main goal is to transform a basic model that predicts text into an assistant that can follow instructions and answer questions. SFT can also enhance the model's overall performance, add new knowledge, or adapt it to specific tasks and domains. Fine-tuned models can then go through an optional preference alignment stage (see my article about DPO) to remove unwanted responses, modify their style, and more.\n",
            "The following figure shows an instruction sample. It includes a system prompt to steer the model, a user prompt to provide a task, and the output the model is expected to generate. You can find a list of high-quality open-source instruction datasets in the üíæ LLM Datasets GitHub repo.\n",
            "Before considering SFT, I recommend trying prompt engineering techniques like few-shot prompting or retrieval augmented generation (RAG). In practice, these methods can solve many problems without the need for fine-tuning, using either closed-source or open-weight models (e.g., Llama 3.1 Instruct). If this approach doesn't meet your objectives (in terms of quality, cost, latency, etc.), then SFT becomes a viable option when instruction data is available. Note that SFT also offers benefits like additional control and customizability to create personalized LLMs.\n",
            "However, SFT has limitations. It works best when leveraging knowledge already present in the base model. Learning completely new information like an unknown language can be challenging and lead to more frequent hallucinations. For new domains unknown to the base model, it is recommended to continuously pre-train it on a raw dataset first.\n",
            "On the opposite end of the spectrum, instruct models (i.e., already fine-tuned models) can already be very close to your requirements. For example, a model might perform very well but state that it was trained by OpenAI or Meta instead of you. In this case, you might want to slightly steer the instruct model's behavior using preference alignment. By providing chosen and rejected samples for a small set of instructions (between 100 and 1000 samples), you can force the LLM to say that you trained it instead of OpenAI.\n",
            "\t\t‚öñÔ∏è SFT Techniques\n",
            "The three most popular SFT techniques are full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA.\n",
            "Full fine-tuning is the most straightforward SFT technique. It involves retraining all parameters of a pre-trained model on an instruction dataset. This method often provides the best results but requires significant computational resources (several high-end GPUs are required to fine-tune a 8B model). Because it modifies the entire model, it is also the most destructive method and can lead to the catastrophic forgetting of previous skills and knowledge.\n",
            "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. Instead of retraining the entire model, it freezes the weights and introduces small adapters (low-rank matrices) at each targeted layer. This allows LoRA to train a number of parameters that is drastically lower than full fine-tuning (less than 1%), reducing both memory usage and training time. This method is non-destructive since the original parameters are frozen, and adapters can then be switched or combined at will.\n",
            "QLoRA (Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adaptation) is an extension of LoRA that offers even greater memory savings. It provides up to 33% additional memory reduction compared to standard LoRA, making it particularly useful when GPU memory is constrained. This increased efficiency comes at the cost of longer training times, with QLoRA typically taking about 39% more time to train than regular LoRA.\n",
            "While QLoRA requires more training time, its substantial memory savings can make it the only viable option in scenarios where GPU memory is limited. For this reason, this is the technique we will use in the next section to fine-tune a Llama 3.1 8B model on Google Colab.\n",
            "\t\tü¶ô Fine-Tune Llama 3.1 8B\n",
            "To efficiently fine-tune a Llama 3.1 8B model, we'll use the Unsloth library by Daniel and Michael Han. Thanks to its custom kernels, Unsloth provides 2x faster training and 60% memory use compared to other options, making it ideal in a constrained environment like Colab. Unfortunately, Unsloth only supports single-GPU settings at the moment. For multi-GPU settings, I recommend popular alternatives like TRL and Axolotl (both also include Unsloth as a backend).\n",
            "In this example, we will QLoRA fine-tune it on the mlabonne/FineTome-100k dataset. It's a subset of arcee-ai/The-Tome (without arcee-ai/qwen2-72b-magpie-en) that I re-filtered using HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier. Note that this classifier wasn't designed for instruction data quality evaluation, but we can use it as a rough proxy. The resulting FineTome is an ultra-high quality dataset that includes conversations, reasoning problems, function calling, and more.\n",

We load in NF4 format using the bitsandbytes library.\n",
            "When loading the model, we must specify a maximum sequence length, which restricts its context window. Llama 3.1 supports up to 128k context length, but we will set it to 2,048 in this example since it consumes more compute and VRAM. Finally, the dtype parameter automatically detects if your GPU supports the BF16 format for more stability during training (this feature is restricted to Ampere and more recent GPUs).\n",

            "Now that our model is loaded in 4-bit precision, we want to prepare it for parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA adapters. LoRA has three important parameters:\n",
            "Rank (r), which determines LoRA matrix size. Rank typically starts at 8 but can go up to 256. Higher ranks can store more information but increase the computational and memory cost of LoRA. We set it to 16 here.\n",
            "Alpha (Œ±), a scaling factor for updates. Alpha directly impacts the adapters' contribution and is often set to 1x or 2x the rank value.\n",
            "Target modules: LoRA can be applied to various model components, including attention mechanisms (Q, K, V matrices), output projections, feed-forward blocks, and linear output layers. While initially focused on attention mechanisms, extending LoRA to other components has shown benefits. However, adapting more modules increases the number of trainable parameters and memory needs.\n",
            "Here, we set r=16, Œ±=16, and target every linear module to maximize quality. We don't use dropout and biases for faster training.\n",
            "In addition, we will use Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA), which modifies the scaling factor of LoRA adapters to be proportional to 1/‚àör instead of 1/r. This stabilizes learning (especially for higher adapter ranks) and allows for improved fine-tuning performance as rank increases. Gradient checkpointing is handled by Unsloth to offload input and output embeddings to disk and save VRAM.\n",

            "Let's now load and prepare our dataset. Instruction datasets are stored in a particular format: it can be Alpaca, ShareGPT, OpenAI, etc. First, we want to parse this format to retrieve our instructions and answers. Our mlabonne/FineTome-100k dataset uses the ShareGPT format with a unique \"conversations\" column containing messages in JSONL. Unlike simpler formats like Alpaca, ShareGPT is ideal for storing multi-turn conversations, which is closer to how users interact with LLMs.\n",
            "Once our instruction-answer pairs are parsed, we want to reformat them to follow a chat template. Chat templates are a way to structure conversations between users and models. They typically include special tokens to identify the beginning and the end of a message, who's speaking, etc. Base models don't have chat templates so we can choose any: ChatML, Llama3, Mistral, etc. In the open-source community, the ChatML template (originally from OpenAI) is a popular option.

            "We're now ready to specify the training parameters for our run. I want to briefly introduce the most important hyperparameters:\n",
            "Learning rate: It controls how strongly the model updates its parameters. Too low, and training will be slow and may get stuck in local minima. Too high, and training may become unstable or diverge, which degrades performance.\n",
            "LR scheduler: It adjusts the learning rate (LR) during training, starting with a higher LR for rapid initial progress and then decreasing it in later stages. Linear and cosine schedulers are the two most common options.\n",
            "Batch size: Number of samples processed before the weights are updated. Larger batch sizes generally lead to more stable gradient estimates and can improve training speed, but they also require more memory. Gradient accumulation allows for effectively larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients over multiple forward/backward passes before updating the model.\n",
            "Num epochs: The number of complete passes through the training dataset. More epochs allow the model to see the data more times, potentially leading to better performance. However, too many epochs can cause overfitting.\n",
            "Optimizer: Algorithm used to adjust the parameters of a model to minimize the loss function. In practice, AdamW 8-bit is strongly recommended: it performs as well as the 32-bit version while using less GPU memory. The paged version of AdamW is only interesting in distributed settings.\n",
            "Weight decay: A regularization technique that adds a penalty for large weights to the loss function. It helps prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to learn simpler, more generalizable features. However, too much weight decay can impede learning.\n",
            "Warmup steps: A period at the beginning of training where the learning rate is gradually increased from a small value to the initial learning rate. Warmup can help stabilize early training, especially with large learning rates or batch sizes, by allowing the model to adjust to the data distribution before making large updates.\n",
            "Packing: Batches have a pre-defined sequence length. Instead of assigning one batch per sample, we can combine multiple small samples in one batch, increasing efficiency.\n",
            "I trained the model on the entire dataset (100k samples) using an A100 GPU (40 GB of VRAM) on Google Colab. The training took 4 hours and 45 minutes. Of course, you can use smaller GPUs with less VRAM and a smaller batch size, but they're not nearly as fast. For example, it takes roughly 19 hours and 40 minutes on an L4 and a whopping 47 hours on a free T4.\n",
            "In this case, I recommend only loading a subset of the dataset to speed up training. You can do it by modifying the previous code block, like dataset = load_dataset(\"mlabonne/FineTome-100k\", split=\"train[:10000]\") to only load 10k samples.

Instead of using frozen, general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, you can fine-tune Llama 3.1 for your specific use cases to achieve better performance and customizability at a lower cost.\n",
            "In this article, we will provide a comprehensive overview of supervised fine-tuning. We will compare it to prompt engineering to understand when it makes sense to use it, detail the main techniques with their pros and cons, and introduce major concepts, such as LoRA hyperparameters, storage formats, and chat templates. Finally, we will implement it in practice by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B in Google Colab with state-of-the-art optimization using Unsloth.\n",
            "All the code used in this article is available on Google Colab and in the LLM Course. Special thanks to Daniel Han for answering my questions.\n",
            "\t\tüîß Supervised Fine-Tuning\n",
            "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a method to improve and customize pre-trained LLMs. It involves retraining base models on a smaller dataset of instructions and answers. The main goal is to transform a basic model that predicts text into an assistant that can follow instructions and answer questions. SFT can also enhance the model's overall performance, add new knowledge, or adapt it to specific tasks and domains. Fine-tuned models can then go through an optional preference alignment stage (see my article about DPO) to remove unwanted responses, modify their style, and more.\n",
            "The following figure shows an instruction sample. It includes a system prompt to steer the model, a user prompt to provide a task, and the output the model is expected to generate. You can find a list of high-quality open-source instruction datasets in the üíæ LLM Datasets GitHub repo.\n",
            "Before considering SFT, I recommend trying prompt engineering techniques like few-shot prompting or retrieval augmented generation (RAG). In practice, these methods can solve many problems without the need for fine-tuning, using either closed-source or open-weight models (e.g., Llama 3.1 Instruct). If this approach doesn't meet your objectives (in terms of quality, cost, latency, etc.), then SFT becomes a viable option when instruction data is available. Note that SFT also offers benefits like additional control and customizability to create personalized LLMs.\n",
            "However, SFT has limitations. It works best when leveraging knowledge already present in the base model. Learning completely new information like an unknown language can be challenging and lead to more frequent hallucinations. For new domains unknown to the base model, it is recommended to continuously pre-train it on a raw dataset first.\n",
            "On the opposite end of the spectrum, instruct models (i.e., already fine-tuned models) can already be very close to your requirements. For example, a model might perform very well but state that it was trained by OpenAI or Meta instead of you. In this case, you might want to slightly steer the instruct model's behavior using preference alignment. By providing chosen and rejected samples for a small set of instructions (between 100 and 1000 samples), you can force the LLM to say that you trained it instead of OpenAI.\n",
            "\t\t‚öñÔ∏è SFT Techniques\n",
            "The three most popular SFT techniques are full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA.\n",
            "Full fine-tuning is the most straightforward SFT technique. It involves retraining all parameters of a pre-trained model on an instruction dataset. This method often provides the best results but requires significant computational resources (several high-end GPUs are required to fine-tune a 8B model). Because it modifies the entire model, it is also the most destructive method and can lead to the catastrophic forgetting of previous skills and knowledge.\n",
            "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. Instead of retraining the entire model, it freezes the weights and introduces small adapters (low-rank matrices) at each targeted layer. This allows LoRA to train a number of parameters that is drastically lower than full fine-tuning (less than 1%), reducing both memory usage and training time. This method is non-destructive since the original parameters are frozen, and adapters can then be switched or combined at will.\n",
            "QLoRA (Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adaptation) is an extension of LoRA that offers even greater memory savings. It provides up to 33% additional memory reduction compared to standard LoRA, making it particularly useful when GPU memory is constrained. This increased efficiency comes at the cost of longer training times, with QLoRA typically taking about 39% more time to train than regular LoRA.\n",
            "While QLoRA requires more training time, its substantial memory savings can make it the only viable option in scenarios where GPU memory is limited. For this reason, this is the technique we will use in the next section to fine-tune a Llama 3.1 8B model on Google Colab.\n",
            "\t\tü¶ô Fine-Tune Llama 3.1 8B\n",
            "To efficiently fine-tune a Llama 3.1 8B model, we'll use the Unsloth library by Daniel and Michael Han. Thanks to its custom kernels, Unsloth provides 2x faster training and 60% memory use compared to other options, making it ideal in a constrained environment like Colab. Unfortunately, Unsloth only supports single-GPU settings at the moment. For multi-GPU settings, I recommend popular alternatives like TRL and Axolotl (both also include Unsloth as a backend).\n",
            "In this example, we will QLoRA fine-tune it on the mlabonne/FineTome-100k dataset. It's a subset of arcee-ai/The-Tome (without arcee-ai/qwen2-72b-magpie-en) that I re-filtered using HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier. Note that this classifier wasn't designed for instruction data quality evaluation, but we can use it as a rough proxy. The resulting FineTome is an ultra-high quality dataset that includes conversations, reasoning problems, function calling, and more.\n",

            "Batch size: Number of samples processed before the weights are updated. Larger batch sizes generally lead to more stable gradient estimates and can improve training speed, but they also require more memory. Gradient accumulation allows for effectively larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients over multiple forward/backward passes before updating the model.\n",
            "Num epochs: The number of complete passes through the training dataset. More epochs allow the model to see the data more times, potentially leading to better performance. However, too many epochs can cause overfitting.\n",
            "Optimizer: Algorithm used to adjust the parameters of a model to minimize the loss function. In practice, AdamW 8-bit is strongly recommended: it performs as well as the 32-bit version while using less GPU memory. The paged version of AdamW is only interesting in distributed settings.\n",
            "Weight decay: A regularization technique that adds a penalty for large weights to the loss function. It helps prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to learn simpler, more generalizable features. However, too much weight decay can impede learning.\n",
            "Warmup steps: A period at the beginning of training where the learning rate is gradually increased from a small value to the initial learning rate. Warmup can help stabilize early training, especially with large learning rates or batch sizes, by allowing the model to adjust to the data distribution before making large updates.\n",
            "Packing: Batches have a pre-defined sequence length. Instead of assigning one batch per sample, we can combine multiple small samples in one batch, increasing efficiency.\n",
            "I trained the model on the entire dataset (100k samples) using an A100 GPU (40 GB of VRAM) on Google Colab. The training took 4 hours and 45 minutes. Of course, you can use smaller GPUs with less VRAM and a smaller batch size, but they're not nearly as fast. For example, it takes roughly 19 hours and 40 minutes on an L4 and a whopping 47 hours on a free T4.\n",

            "### üîß Supervised Fine-Tuning\n",
            "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a method to improve and customize pre-trained LLMs. It involves retraining base models on a smaller dataset of instructions and answers. The main goal is to transform a basic model that predicts text into an assistant that can follow instructions and answer questions. SFT can also enhance the model's overall performance, add new knowledge, or adapt it to specific tasks and domains. Fine-tuned models can then go through an optional preference alignment stage (see my article about DPO) to remove unwanted responses, modify their style, and more.\n",
            "\n",
            "The following figure shows an instruction sample. It includes a system prompt to steer the model, a user prompt to provide a task, and the output the model is expected to generate. You can find a list of high-quality open-source instruction datasets in the üíæ LLM Datasets GitHub repo.\n",
            "\n",
            "Before considering SFT, I recommend trying prompt engineering techniques like few-shot prompting or retrieval augmented generation (RAG). In practice, these methods can solve many problems without the need for fine-tuning, using either closed-source or open-weight models (e.g., Llama 3.1 Instruct). If this approach doesn't meet your objectives (in terms of quality, cost, latency, etc.), then SFT becomes a viable option when instruction data is available. Note that SFT also offers benefits like additional control and customizability to create personalized LLMs.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, SFT has limitations. It works best when leveraging knowledge already present in the base model. Learning completely new information like an unknown language can be challenging and lead to more frequent hallucinations. For new domains unknown to the base model, it is recommended to continuously pre-train it on a raw dataset first.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the opposite end of the spectrum, instruct models (i.e., already fine-tuned models) can already be very close to your requirements. For example, a model might perform very well but state that it was trained by OpenAI or Meta instead of you. In this case, you might want to slightly steer the instruct model's behavior using preference alignment. By providing chosen and rejected samples for a small set of instructions (between 100 and 1000 samples), you can force the LLM to say that you trained it instead of OpenAI.\n",
            "\n",
            "### ‚öñÔ∏è SFT Techniques\n",
            "The three most popular SFT techniques are full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA.\n",
            "\n",
            "Full fine-tuning is the most straightforward SFT technique. It involves retraining all parameters of a pre-trained model on an instruction dataset. This method often provides the best results but requires significant computational resources (several high-end GPUs are required to fine-tune a 8B model). Because it modifies the entire model, it is also the most destructive method and can lead to the catastrophic forgetting of previous skills and knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. Instead of retraining the entire model, it freezes the weights and introduces small adapters (low-rank matrices) at each targeted layer. This allows LoRA to train a number of parameters that is drastically lower than full fine-tuning (less than 1%), reducing both memory usage and training time. This method is non-destructive since the original parameters are frozen, and adapters can then be switched or combined at will.\n",
            "\n",
            "QLoRA (Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adaptation) is an extension of LoRA that offers even greater memory savings. It provides up to 33% additional memory reduction compared to standard LoRA, making it particularly useful when GPU memory is constrained. This increased efficiency comes at the cost of longer training times, with QLoRA typically taking about 39% more time to train than regular LoRA.\n",
            "\n",
            "While QLoRA requires more training time, its substantial memory savings can make it the only viable option in scenarios where GPU memory is limited. For this reason, this is the technique we will use in the next section to fine-tune a Llama 3.1 8B model on Google Colab.\n",
            "\n",

            "To efficiently fine-tune a Llama 3.1 8B model, we'll use the Unsloth library by Daniel and Michael Han. Thanks to its custom kernels, Unsloth provides 2x faster training and 60% memory use compared to other options, making it ideal in a constrained environment like Colab. Unfortunately, Unsloth only supports single-GPU settings at the moment. For multi-GPU settings, I recommend popular alternatives like TRL and Axolotl (both also include Unsloth as a backend).\n",

            "In this example, we will QLoRA fine-tune it on the mlabonne/FineTome-100k dataset.

            "Batch size: Number of samples processed before the weights are updated.

Gradient accumulation allows for effectively larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients over multiple forward/backward passes before updating the model.\n",

            "Num epochs: The number of complete passes through the training dataset. More epochs allow the model to see the data more times, potentially leading to better performance. However, too many epochs can cause overfitting.\n",

            "Warmup steps: A period at the beginning of training where the learning rate is gradually increased from a small value to the initial learning rate.

The goal is to transform a basic model into an assistant that follows instructions and answers questions. SFT can also improve overall performance, add new knowledge, or adapt to specific tasks. Fine-tuned models can undergo preference alignment to remove unwanted responses and modify style.\\\\n\\\\nThe provided figure illustrates an instruction sample, including a system prompt, user prompt, and expected output. High-quality open-source instruction datasets are available in the \\\\uf8ff\\\\u00fc\\\\u00ed\\\\u00e6 LLM Datasets GitHub repo.\\\\n\\\\nPrompt engineering techniques like few-shot prompting or RAG are recommended before SFT. These methods can solve many problems without fine-tuning, using closed-source or open-weight models. If these techniques don't meet objectives, SFT becomes an option when instruction data is available, offering additional control and customizability.\\\\n\\\\nSFT has limitations. It works best with knowledge present in the base model. Learning new information can be challenging and lead to hallucinations. For new domains, pre-training on a raw dataset is advised.\\\\n\\\\nInstruct models, already fine-tuned, might be close to requirements. For instance, a model might perform well but state incorrect training attribution. Preference alignment can be used to steer behavior, e.g., forcing the LLM to say it was trained by you instead of OpenAI.\\\\n\\\\n### \\\\u201a\\\\u00f6\\\\u00f1\\\\u00d4\\\\u220f\\\\u00e8 SFT Techniques\\\\nThree popular SFT techniques are full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA.\\\\n\\\\nFull fine-tuning retrains all parameters, often providing the best results but requiring significant resources. It's destructive and can lead to catastrophic forgetting.\\\\n\\\\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is parameter-efficient, freezing weights and introducing small adapters. It reduces memory usage and training time, is non-destructive, and allows adapter switching/combining.\\\\n\\\\nQLoRA extends LoRA, offering 33% more memory reduction but 39% longer training time. It's useful when GPU memory is limited.\\\\n\\\\n### \\\\uf8ff\\\\u00fc\\\\u00b6\\\\u00f4 Fine-Tune Llama 3.1 8B\\\\nTo efficiently fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, the Unsloth library is used, providing 2x faster training and 60% memory use. It's ideal for Google Colab but currently supports single-GPU settings. Alternatives like TRL and Axolotl are recommended for multi-GPU.\\\\n\\\\nThe example uses QLoRA to fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B on the mlabonne/FineTome-100k dataset, a high-quality subset of arcee-ai/The-Tome. The dataset includes conversations, reasoning problems, and function calling.\\\\n\\\\nThe code installs required libraries and imports them. The model is loaded in 4-bit precision, and LoRA is prepared with specific parameters for efficient fine-tuning. The dataset is loaded and prepared, and training parameters are specified.\\\\n\\\\nThe model is trained on an A100 GPU, taking 4 hours and 45 minutes. Smaller GPUs are slower, and the article suggests loading a subset of the dataset or using cheaper cloud GPU providers.\\\\n\\\\nThe trained model is tested with a prompt, and the response is correct. The model is saved locally and uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub. It's also converted to GGUF format and uploaded in various precisions.\\\", \\\"coworker\\\": \\\"Senior Support Representative\\\"}\"\u001b[00m\n",
