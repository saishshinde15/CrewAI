guideOn this pageConceptual guide\\nThis guide provides explanations of the key concepts behind the LangChain framework and AI applications more broadly.\\nWe recommend that you go through at least one of the Tutorials before diving into the conceptual guide. This will provide practical context that will make it easier to understand the concepts discussed here.\\nThe conceptual guide does not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation examples — those are found in the How-to guides and Tutorials. For detailed reference material, please see the API reference.\\nHigh level\\u200b\\n\\nWhy LangChain?: Overview of the value that LangChain provides.\\nArchitecture: How packages are organized in the LangChain ecosystem.\\n\\nConcepts\\u200b\\n\\nChat models: LLMs exposed via a chat API that process sequences of messages as input and output a message.\\nMessages: The unit of communication in chat models, used to represent model input and output.\\nChat history: A conversation represented as a sequence of messages, alternating between user messages and model responses.\\nTools: A function with an associated schema defining the function\\'s name, description, and the arguments it accepts.\\nTool calling: A type of chat model API that accepts tool schemas, along with messages, as input and returns invocations of those tools as part of the output message.\\nStructured output: A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.\\nMemory: Information about a conversation that is persisted so that it can be used in future conversations.\\nMultimodality: The ability to work with data that comes in different forms, such as text, audio, images, and video.\\nRunnable interface: The base abstraction that many LangChain components and the LangChain Expression Language are built on.\\nStreaming: LangChain streaming APIs for surfacing results as they are generated.\\nLangChain Expression Language (LCEL): A syntax for orchestrating LangChain components. Most useful for simpler applications.\\nDocument loaders: Load a source as a list of documents.\\nRetrieval: Information retrieval systems can retrieve structured or unstructured data from a datasource in response to a query.\\nText splitters: Split long text into smaller chunks that can be individually indexed to enable granular retrieval.\\nEmbedding models: Models that represent data such as text or images in a vector space.\\nVector stores: Storage of and efficient search over vectors and associated metadata.\\nRetriever: A component that returns relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to a query.\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): A technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases.\\nAgents: Use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. Agents can interact with external resources via tool.\\nPrompt templates: Component for factoring out the static parts of a model \"prompt\" (usually a sequence of messages). Useful for serializing, versioning, and reusing these static parts.\\nOutput parsers: Responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it into a more suitable format for downstream tasks. Output parsers were primarily useful prior to the general availability of tool calling and structured outputs.\\nFew-shot prompting: A technique for improving model performance by providing a few examples of the task to perform in the prompt.\\nExample selectors: Used to select the most relevant examples from a dataset based on a given input. Example selectors are used in few-shot prompting to select examples for a prompt.\\nAsync programming: The basics that one should know to use LangChain in an asynchronous context.\\nCallbacks: Callbacks enable the execution of custom auxiliary code in built-in components. Callbacks are used to stream outputs from LLMs in LangChain, trace the intermediate steps of an application, and more.\\nTracing: The process of recording the steps that an application takes to go from input to output. Tracing is essential for debugging and diagnosing issues in complex applications.\\nEvaluation: The process of assessing the performance and effectiveness of AI applications. This involves testing the model\\'s responses against a set of predefined criteria or benchmarks to ensure it meets the desired quality standards and fulfills the intended purpose. This process is vital for building reliable applications.\\nTesting: The process of verifying that a component of an integration or application works as expected. Testing is essential for ensuring that the application behaves correctly and that changes to the codebase do not introduce new bugs.\\n\\nGlossary\\u200b\\n\\nAIMessageChunk: A partial response from an AI message. Used when streaming responses from a chat model.\\nAIMessage: Represents a complete response from an AI model.\\nastream_events: Stream granular information from LCEL chains.\\nBaseTool: The base class for all tools in LangChain.\\nbatch: Use to execute a runnable with batch inputs.\\nbind_tools: Allows models to interact with tools.\\nCaching: Storing results to avoid redundant calls to a chat model.\\nChat models: Chat models that handle multiple data modalities.\\nConfigurable runnables: Creating configurable Runnables.\\nContext window: The maximum size of input a chat model can process.\\nConversation patterns: Common patterns in chat interactions.\\nDocument: LangChain\\'s representation of a document.\\nEmbedding models: Models that generate vector embeddings for various data types.\\nHumanMessage: Represents a message from a human user.\\nInjectedState: A state injected into a tool function.\\nInjectedStore: A store that can be injected into a tool for data persistence.\\nInjectedToolArg: Mechanism to inject arguments into tool functions.\\ninput and output types: Types used for input and output in Runnables.\\nIntegration packages: Third-party packages that integrate with LangChain.\\nIntegration tests: Tests that verify the correctness of the interaction between components, usually run with access to the underlying API that powers an integration.\\ninvoke: A standard method to invoke a Runnable.\\nJSON mode: Returning responses in JSON format.\\nlangchain-community: Community-driven components for LangChain.\\nlangchain-core: Core langchain package. Includes base interfaces and in-memory implementations.\\nlangchain: A package for higher level components (e.g., some pre-built chains).\\nlanggraph: Powerful orchestration layer for LangChain. Use to build complex pipelines and workflows.\\nlangserve: Used to deploy LangChain Runnables as REST endpoints. Uses FastAPI. Works primarily for LangChain Runnables, does not currently integrate with LangGraph.\\nLLMs (legacy): Older language models that take a string as input and return a string as output.\\nManaging chat history: Techniques to maintain and manage the chat history.\\nOpenAI format: OpenAI\\'s message format for chat models.\\nPropagation of RunnableConfig: Propagating configuration through Runnables.

For detailed reference material, please see the API reference.\\nLangGraph¶\\nHigh Level\\n\\nWhy LangGraph?: A high-level overview of LangGraph and its goals.\\n\\nConcepts\\n\\nLangGraph Glossary: LangGraph workflows are designed as graphs, with nodes representing different components and edges representing the flow of information between them. This guide provides an overview of the key concepts associated with LangGraph graph primitives.\\nCommon Agentic Patterns: An agent uses an LLM to pick its own control flow to solve more complex problems! Agents are a key building block in many LLM applications. This guide explains the different types of agent architectures and how they can be used to control the flow of an application.\\nMulti-Agent Systems: Complex LLM applications can often be broken down into multiple agents, each responsible for a different part of the application. This guide explains common patterns for building multi-agent systems.\\nBreakpoints: Breakpoints allow pausing the execution of a graph at specific points. Breakpoints allow stepping through graph execution for debugging purposes.\\nHuman-in-the-Loop: Explains different ways of integrating human feedback into a LangGraph application.\\nTime Travel: Time travel allows you to replay past actions in your LangGraph application to explore alternative paths and debug issues.\\nPersistence: LangGraph has a built-in persistence layer, implemented through checkpointers. This persistence layer helps to support powerful capabilities like human-in-the-loop, memory, time travel, and fault-tolerance.\\nMemory: Memory in AI applications refers to the ability to process, store, and effectively recall information from past interactions. With memory, your agents can learn from feedback and adapt to users' preferences.  \\nStreaming: Streaming is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on LLMs. By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs. \\nFAQ: Frequently asked questions about LangGraph.\\n\\nLangGraph Platform¶\\nLangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications in production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.\\nThe LangGraph Platform offers a few different deployment options described in the deployment options guide.\\n\\nTip\\n\\nLangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library, which we are committed to maintaining and growing for the community.\\nYou can always deploy LangGraph applications on your own infrastructure using the open-source LangGraph project without using LangGraph Platform.\\n\\n\\nHigh Level¶\\n\\nWhy LangGraph Platform?: The LangGraph platform is an opinionated way to deploy and manage LangGraph applications. This guide provides an overview of the key features and concepts behind LangGraph Platform.\\nDeployment Options: LangGraph Platform offers four deployment options: Self-Hosted Lite, Self-Hosted Enterprise, bring your own cloud (BYOC), and Cloud SaaS. This guide explains the differences between these options, and which Plans they are available on.\\nPlans: LangGraph Platforms offer three different plans: Developer, Plus, Enterprise. This guide explains the differences between these options, what deployment options are available for each, and how to sign up for each one.\\nTemplate Applications: Reference applications designed to help you get started quickly when building with LangGraph.\\n\\nComponents¶\\nThe LangGraph Platform comprises several components that work together to support the deployment and management of LangGraph applications:\\n\\nLangGraph Server: The LangGraph Server is designed to support a wide range of agentic application use cases, from background processing to real-time interactions. \\nLangGraph Studio: LangGraph Studio is a specialized IDE that can connect to a LangGraph Server to enable visualization, interaction, and debugging of the application locally.\\nLangGraph CLI: LangGraph CLI is a command-line interface that helps to interact with a local LangGraph\\nPython/JS SDK: The Python/JS SDK provides a programmatic way to interact with deployed LangGraph Applications.\\nRemote Graph: A RemoteGraph allows you to interact with any deployed LangGraph application as though it were running locally.\\n\\nLangGraph Server¶\\n\\nApplication Structure: A LangGraph application consists of one or more graphs, a LangGraph API Configuration file (langgraph.json), a file that specifies dependencies, and environment variables.\\nAssistants: Assistants are a way to save and manage different configurations of your LangGraph applications.\\nWeb-hooks: Webhooks allow your running LangGraph application to send data to external services on specific events.\\nCron Jobs: Cron jobs are a way to schedule tasks to run at specific times in your LangGraph application.\\nDouble Texting: Double texting is a common issue in LLM applications where users may send multiple messages before the graph has finished running. This guide explains how to handle double texting with LangGraph Deploy.\\nAuthentication & Access Control: Learn about options for authentication and access control when deploying the LangGraph Platform.\\n\\nDeployment Options¶\\n\\nSelf-Hosted Lite: A free (up to 1 million nodes executed), limited version of LangGraph Platform that you can run locally or in a self-hosted manner\\nCloud SaaS: Hosted as part of LangSmith.\\nBring Your Own Cloud: We manage the infrastructure, so you don't have to, but the infrastructure all runs within your cloud.\\nSelf-Hosted Enterprise: Completely managed by you.\\n\\nComments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Back to top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Previous\\n              \\n\\n                Adding nodes as dataset examples in Studio\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Next\\n              \\n\\n                Why LangGraph?\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Made with\\n    \\n      Material for MkDocs Insiders\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\")]"

Unlike unit tests, which focus on individual components, integration tests examine the interactions between various parts, such as chains, LLMs, prompts, and memory components.  They verify that data flows correctly between these modules and that the overall system behaves as expected.  These tests are typically run with access to the APIs of the integrated components (e.g., an LLM API), simulating real-world usage scenarios.  This helps catch integration issues early in the development process, preventing unexpected behavior in production.  For example, an integration test might involve chaining an LLM with a vector database and verifying that the LLM correctly uses information retrieved from the database to generate a response.  Or, it could test the interaction between a chain and a memory component, ensuring that the memory component stores and retrieves information correctly.  Effective integration tests are paramount for building robust and reliable LangChain applications.\u001b[00m\n",

            "Integration testing in LangChain is crucial for ensuring the seamless interaction and correct functionality of various components within your application. Unlike unit tests, which focus on individual modules in isolation, integration tests examine how these modules interact and function together as a cohesive system.  In the context of LangChain, this involves verifying the interplay between various elements such as:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Chains:**  Testing the complete flow of data and logic across multiple chain steps, ensuring each step correctly processes the output of the previous step.\n",
            "* **LLMs:** Validating that the chosen Large Language Model (LLM) integrates correctly and provides the expected responses within the chain. This includes verifying proper prompt formatting and handling of LLM-specific outputs.\n",
            "* **Prompts:**  Ensuring prompts are correctly formatted and passed to the LLM, and that the LLM's responses are correctly interpreted and processed.\n",
            "* **Memory:** Confirming that memory components (e.g., ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationSummaryMemory) correctly store and retrieve information, impacting the chain's behavior across multiple turns.\n",
            "* **Agents:**  Testing the interaction between agents, LLMs, and tools, verifying the agent correctly selects and utilizes tools based on the LLM's response and the current context. This also includes validating the correct handling of tool outputs.\n",
            "* **External APIs and Databases:**  Verifying that interactions with external systems (APIs, databases) are handled correctly, including error handling and data consistency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Integration tests usually involve running a significant portion, or even the entirety, of the LangChain application, simulating real-world scenarios.  This often requires access to the underlying APIs of the components being tested, enabling more realistic simulations.  Successful integration tests provide confidence that your application functions correctly as a unified whole, not just as a collection of independently working parts. They help identify integration points where unexpected behavior or errors might occur due to unforeseen interactions.  These tests are essential for ensuring the reliability, robustness, and stability of complex LangChain applications, particularly before deployment to production environments.  They are a critical component of a comprehensive testing strategy, supplementing unit and other types of testing to provide a higher level of assurance in the overall quality of the application.\n"
